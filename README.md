# Jarvis
### Why?

I created JARVIS with two goals in mind:

1. It should have a lot of useful features (both fun and commonly used).
1. Anyone can contribute to this project. (As this is module-based, anybody with a decent knowledge of Python can contribute.) One of the prime goals of this project is to lower the entry barrier into the world of open source.
